## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each? 
Waterfall Description: 
°Linear and Sequential: Waterfall is a traditional project management approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins. It follows a linear sequence: Requirements → Design → Implementation → Verification → Maintenance. 
°Advantages: 
°Clear Structure: The linear process is easy to understand and manage. Each phase has specific deliverables and timelines. 
°Documentation: Extensive documentation is produced, which can be useful for future reference and maintaining consistency. 
°Predictability: Well-defined phases and requirements can lead to predictable outcomes and schedules. 
Disadvantages: 
°Inflexibility: Changes are difficult and costly once the project is underway. This can be problematic if requirements evolve. 
°Delayed Testing: Testing occurs only after implementation, which can lead to late discovery of issues. 
°Risk of Obsolescence: By the time the project is completed, the initial requirements might be outdated. 
*Agile Description: 
°Iterative and Incremental: Agile emphasizes flexibility and iterative progress through cycles called sprints. It focuses on continuous improvement, collaboration, and customer feedback. 
Advantages: 
°Flexibility: Agile allows for changes and adjustments throughout the project. This helps accommodate evolving requirements.
